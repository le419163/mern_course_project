This is my build for the MERN course




================================
| EXPRESS BACK END APPLICATION |
================================

Express is a Node.js web application framework.

Can be used to build out APIs for a back end.

Connects to mongoDB for database. - mongo cluster connection string = mongo "mongodb+srv://dev-connector.arrce.mongodb.net/<dbname>" --username ryan123

-----------------------------------------
| Directory Structure of Social Web App |
-----------------------------------------

Models directory contains the database schema models.
    - Posts object
    - Profile object
    - User object

Config directory dictates mongo connection and other config data.

Routes/API directory contains the api methods that make up the routes.

Middleware directory contains functions that have access to req,res, & next (to do things in the 'middle' of the call, like authenticate token).

The file 'server.js' contains the api routes, starts db connection and server port for app.

Authentication:
Register a user to the mongoDB
Login with user to get token
