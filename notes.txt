This is my build for the MERN course

Uses React for front end
Uses mongoDB for database, mongoose for object modeling in mongodb
Uses Express for back end, uses Node.js
Uses gravatar for user avatars
Uses Postman for api development/testing
Deploys to heroku

Initialize and start app:
use 'npm start' or 'npm run server' to run with nodemon
make requests in postman after connecting to local host in postman
need to authenticate user to get auth token, then make api calls

How to connect to mongoDB for project:
login to cloud.mongodb.com with ryandodson33@gmail.com and h password
launch app to connect it to mongodb



================================
| EXPRESS BACK END APPLICATION |
================================

Express is a Node.js web application framework.

Can be used to build out APIs for a back end.

Connects to mongoDB for database. - mongo cluster connection string = mongo "mongodb+srv://dev-connector.arrce.mongodb.net/<dbname>" --username ryan123

-----------------------------------------
| Directory Structure of Social Web App |
-----------------------------------------

Models directory contains the database schema models.
    - Posts object
    - Profile object
    - User object

Config directory dictates mongo connection and other config data.

Routes/API directory contains the api methods that make up the routes.

Middleware directory contains functions that have access to req, res, & next (to do things in the 'middle' of the call, like authenticate token).

The file 'server.js' contains the api routes, starts db connection and server port for app.

Authentication:
Register a user to the mongoDB
Login with user to get token
